            <h1> A Partiful Exploration of Partiful's Event Customization Page </h1>
            <p>
                Our group was tasked with designing new additions to <a href="https://partiful.com/create" target="_blank"> Partiful</a>'s Event Customization Page, 
                which is where users create and customize their events before inviting guests. 
                In particular, our goal was to make the page customization experience even more 
                "Partiful" ‚Äî to prompt unexpected delight, irreverence, and FUN! üíÉüï∫ I focused on design iteration 
                for the music flow, as well as polishing the idea for the face-cutout cover images.
                This project highlights design iteration skills, receiving feedback, and groupwork.

            <h4 style="margin-top:0;"> Background & Objective </h4>
            <p> Partiful is one of the most popular event planning platforms targeted towards 
                the Gen Z and Millennial demographic. Compared to competitors like Eventbrite and 
                Facebook, Partiful is highly customizable, enabling users to truly capture the vibe 
                of their party or event and delight their guests. </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0;"> Since Partiful has an established platform and design system, our aim was not a complete 
                redesign. Instead, our goal was to introduce new, additional features on top of the 
                existing interface and functionality that would enhance the user experience of event 
                page customizations. </p>

            <div class="section-title"> <h2> I. Ideation and Sketching </h2> <span class="section-line"></span> </div>
            
            <p> We began by examining the existing features Partiful offers and brainstorming a "laundry list" of 
                potential features to add. Eventually, we arrived at the following set of ideas: </p>
            <div class="laundry-list-container">
                <ul>
                    <li>Incorporating music into the invite pages sent to guests</li>
                    <li>Title font customization</li>
                    <li>Animated or interactive cover images (e.g. by including guest faces in the image)</li>
                    <li>Custom page theme generators, either through AI or a color/gradient selector</li>
                    <li>Custom emojis/messages for RSVP-ing to events</li>
                    <li>Ability to tag events (e.g. by rave, birthday, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Custom layout options for invite pages, possibly creatable via a drag-and-drop interface</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="cutout-section">
                    <img src="assets/face-cutout.webp" alt="" style="width: 130px;">
                    <p style="font-size: 12px;"> Maybe something like this could be partiful...üßê </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p> 
                We decided to focus on music, font, and theme customization.

                We chose not to design for the other laundry list items, mostly either due to us perceiving 
                the features as either more technically difficult to implement (for engineers) or simply 
                less of a priority for Partiful as a business.
            </p>
            <p> Below are sketches of our example flows for the chosen features: </p>

                    <p style="margin-top: 0; padding-top: 0;">
                        After discussion, I chose to place the add music feature on top of the title, instead of above the cover as shown in my
                        original sketch. From the invitee‚Äôs perspective, the option to play 
                        and pause the music would be more intuitive to find when located above the title.
                        Music would also come with animations such as the cover image pulsing and dancing wavelengths by the title.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>

                    <p style="margin-top: 0; padding-top: 0;">
                        We narrowed down our design to either utilize the larger modal or the smaller side pop-up. 
                        We eventually decided on using the smaller side pop-up since it would allow users to view 
                        the effect of changing the title font without having to constantly open/close a modal.
                    </p>

                <div>

                    <p style="margin-top: 0; padding-top: 0;">
                        We decided on keeping both options for creating custom themes: using generative AI and a 
                        gradient/color selector, as we believed that the additional flexibility would encourage hosts
                        to use Partiful.

            <p> Based off our initial ideation, discussion, and sketches, our first 
                wireframes can be seen below (through an embedded Figma file): </p>

            <p> After recording an overview of our designs with Loom, we received the following critiques
                from our classmates and client:</p>

            <div class="two-col-grid">
                <div>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; padding-bottom: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> From Partiful </p>
                    <ul style="margin-top: 10px; padding-top: 0; line-height: 1.3rem;">
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Slightly opposed to the complexity of the AI generation and vast range of options for creating a custom color/gradient theme background, citing concerns of low contrast, poor readability, and clutteredness of the theme customization UI</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Instead, they preferred for us to incorporate color customization into their existing themes, e.g. by being able to add a hue to slightly modify the theme color</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">They also suggested a slight pivot in our creative direction, preferring the ‚Äúpartifuliness‚Äù of the custom cover images showcasing guest/host faces</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; padding-bottom: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> From CS1300 classmates </p>
                    <ul style="margin-top: 6px; padding-top: 0; line-height: 1.3rem;">
                       <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Concern about whether adding a pulsing cover image animation along with the music would be too distracting</li>
                       <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Potentially shortening the flow for picking a song, since the current modal to do so is multi-page</li> 
                       <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Consider adding even more customization options, such as drag-and-drop builders for a more personalized template</li>

                </div>
            </div>

        <section>
            <div class="section-title"> <h2> III. Revisions </h2> <span class="section-line"></span> </div>
            <p> After a couple rounds of revising our wireframes, we developed a style guide: </p>

                <img src="assets/style-guide.webp" style="width:70%;" alt="">
            </div>
            <p> Using our guide and sticking to Partiful's brand identity, we developed our design prototype (best viewed full-screen): </p>

                <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); border-radius: 0.5rem;" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2FMLnCI2LS5FmgL1VJp4JFhV%2FPartiful-Event-Page%3Ftype%3Ddesign%26node-id%3D364-818%26t%3DoCL2UNeQ4btzj1og-1%26scaling%3Dmin-zoom%26page-id%3D1%253A2%26starting-point-node-id%3D364%253A818%26mode%3Ddesign" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>
    
            <p> Our main actions from the critiques were: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Scrapping our original AI + gradient theme ideas, instead implementing theme customization as a simple slider to adjust hue for each existing theme </li>
                <li> Adding the feature for interactive (face cutout) cover images </li>
                <li> Not adding more custom layouts, as this was more likely to be overwhelming for users
                    while providing little benefit in "Partiful"ness </li>
                <li> Keeping the multi-page modal of song selection flow </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                After our final rounds of revisions and high-fidelity wireframing, we met with designers, 
                engineers, and founders at Partiful to showcase our work. Overall, while received praise f
                or our innovative designs which captured the "Partiful" spirit, we received a few points 
                of feedback for each of our final flows:
            </p>
            <div>
                <p class="bold-underline"> Flow 1: Music Addition üé∂ </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Problem: The pop up for choosing an event theme song blocks the cover image, 
                        which makes the pulse animation difficult to preview unless the user fully 
                        exits the pop up. It is also unclear that the song clip duration selector 
                        is a drop down.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Solution: Have the cover pulse in the background when the toggle is selected and 
                        making the pop up smaller. Add a small icon to the dropdown to make it more discoverable.

                        on a mobile screen.

                    <li>
                        Solution: Make the font a pop up that goes right on top of the title font section with a 
                        horizontal scroll. This way it is accessible on any device.

                    <li>
                        Problem: It is unclear how to reset the theme to its original state from the current hue slider.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Solution: Implement an intuitive "reset" option, such as re-clicking the selected theme or
                        making the hue bar sticky to reset in the middle.

                    <li>
                        Problem: While the front cover image and back ‚ÄúPartiful your guests‚Äù image flip on click, 
                        that clickable interaction is hard to realize for the user
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Solution: Add a "flip" icon to indicate the cover is flippable
                    </li>

                Overall, I had a ton of fun with this project and loved the experience working with 
                Partiful (whose product I had used many times before)!
            </p>
            <p>
                The most valuable part of the iterative design process was receiving really specific, 
                thoughtful feedback from our points of contact. I saw how important good feedback 
                is as it illuminated crucial blind spots for us to consider that enabled us to 
                refine and ultimately build a better product. Although we know that Partiful is more 
                focused on other aspects of the product right now, we hope that some of our ideas are helpful
                for future design of the event customizations page. :)            
            </p>
            <p>
                Regardless, huge shoutout to Partiful for giving us this wonderful opportunity to work 
                with them on this 3-week long project!
