            <p>
                My team designed and coded a platform to navigate Brown University's 50+ on-campus 
                housing options. We implemented TypeScript algorithms allowing users to search and 
                filter for dorms by preferences such as room size or accommodations, and we integrated 
                Firebase backend and Google user authentication so students can read/write reliable 
                reviews on their dorms. See our GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/Dorms-Brown/Dorms-Brown">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                My role focused on designing the pages of the application in Figma as well as implementing
                the ranking and sorting algorithms in TypeScript.

            <h4 style="margin-top:0;"> Background & Objective </h4>
            <p> 
                Every year during Brown's housing lottery for on-campus dorm selection, students are forced to
                rely on word of mouth and non up-to-date information to make crucial decisions surrounding their 
                housing for the upcoming year. Our solution for making housing research more accessible was 
                Dorms at Brown (D@B), a comprehensive dorm review website akin to Courses @ Brown (C@B).
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0;"> This platform allows students to share detailed reviews and ratings 
                on various aspects of dorm life, such as cleanliness, facilities, and location.
                By aggregating this data, our website also offers an overall "star" rating for each dorm, 
                facilitating informed decision-making during the housing lottery process. With this resource, we 
                sought to alleviate the stress of dorm selection by providing access to valuable dorm-related 
                information for all students participating in the housing lottery. </p>

            <h4 style="margin-top:0;"> Figma Designs </h4>
            <p> 
                I aimed to bring a sense of familiarity to Dorms @ Brown by following the landing Page
                layout of Courses @ Brown. I wanted to make the flow very intuitive in terms of finding the 
                dorms that apply to your class year, so I made these the main focus of the landing page.
                Additionally, I took inspiration from AirBNB's layout for a clean and comprehensive 
                dorm listing design.
            </p>

            <div class="two-col-grid">
                <img class="grid-img" src="assets/dab-home.png" alt="Figma design for Dorms at Brown home page">

            </div>

            <p>On the frontend, we used React.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS for styling.
                This combination allowed us to implement components that could be easily reused throughout the codebase.
            </p>

            <h4 style="margin-top:0;"> Major Components </h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Main: </span> The main Dorms @ Brown page that holds all the other components.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Dorms: </span> Loads a set of dorms (either freshman housing, non-freshman housing, or off-campus housing),
                    as well as a filter box and ranking box with different options for filtering/ranking the list.  
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Dorm: </span> Loads a particular dorm from a set of dorm by retrieving the corresponding document from
                    a Firebase database and displaying the dorm info, rating, and reviews.

                    <span style="font-weight: bold;"> OAuth: </span> Authenticates a user to add a review only if they log in through their `@brown.edu`
                    email address.

                <li>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Profile: </span> Displays profile details once a user authenticates their

                <li>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Reviews:  </span> Handles reviews made by a user, including title, content,

            <h4 style="margin-top:0;"> Technologies </h4>
            
            <p>
                The main technology used for our backend was Node.js (Express.js) to make 
                our backend API endpoint calls. We chose this language because our frontend was 
                using TypeScript, so we thought the integration would be more seamless if we used 
                a JavaScript backend framework.
            </p>
            <p> Backend endpoint calls: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Retrieve list of particular dorms based on dormtype (freshman housing, non-freshman housing, off-campus housing</li>
                <li>Retrieve data of a particular dorm taking the dormtype and id</li>
                <li>Update the rating statistics of a particular dorm</li>
                <li>Delete a review</li>
            </ul>
            <p> Firebase Firestore collections: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>freshman-dorms</li>
                <li>non-freshman-dorms</li>
                <li>off-campus-housing</li>
                <li>users</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 style="margin-top:0;"> Implementing Filter/Sort Algorithms </h4>
            <p>
                I worked on implementing the filter and sort components to 
                navigate a list of dorms. Filtering included room type (singles, doubles,
                triples, suites) and amenities (elevators, semi-private bathrooms, 
                 non-program housing). One difficulty I faced was the boolean logic 
                 behind different sorting options. I found that for room type, 
                 it made sense to include all dorms that included any of the selected 
                 room types (treating it as an "or"). However, for amenities, it made sense to only include dorms 
                 that met ALL selected amenities (treating it as an "and"). I tried to 
                 reflect this difference in the design as well by separating the 
                 filter options within the box.
            </p>

            <h4 style="margin-top:0;"> Space-Time Complexity Choices </h4>
            <p>
                One consideration when designing our storage system was how to store reviews.
                We decided to add each review to two places -- both the particular dorm it was meant
                for and the user's collection. Therefore we could quickly access both the reviews array
                field of a particular dorm as well as reviews written by a certain user, instead 
                of having to loop through all reviews to search for the ones written by a certain user.

                This was my first experience working on a full-stack application that used an API to
                integrate a backend database to a frontend display. It was definitely challenging to 
                build up a complex dorm database and navigate trade-offs such as space-time complexity 
                for our storage and algorithms.
            </p>
            <p>
                With more time, future steps could include adding a 
                search bar for dorms (originally in the design), as well as more precise filtering 
                (eg. filtering for water stations).
