                In the mid 19th century, spiritualism emerged in the Western world as a 
                movement that sought to bridge the gap between the material world and an 
                unseen spiritual realm. This movement gained momentum amidst a society 
                grappling with the aftermath of events like the Civil War, where widespread 
                grief and uncertainty spurred a search for meaning after death. While the 
                rise in engagement with spiritualism provided solace and community to many 
                who needed it, its historical significance extends beyond mere comfort or 
                superstition. In fact, spiritualist practice became a catalyst for scientific 
                inquiry and discovery, challenging the modern belief that historical 
                scientific value must conform to conventional understandings of evidence 
                and objectivity.
            </p>
            <p>
                My project showcases this argument by allowing the user to engage with the convergence 
                of spiritualism and scientific investigation. Through the exploration of 
                various objects, viewers are invited to reassess preconceptions and embrace 
                the possibilities of the unknown. I highlight three prominent scientists – Sir 
                William Fletcher Barrett, Alfred Russell Wallace, and Edmund Edward Fournier 
                d'Albe – who treated elements of spiritualism with scientific scrutiny as they 
                did any other scientific theories of invisible words, such as with germs, 
                evolution, or electromagnetic waves.

                The focus of the website is an art piece featuring two mirrored rooms, digitally painted using Procreate. On the left is the Séance Room, where a circle of chairs surrounds a round table, dimly lit by a candle and chandelier. Resting on the table are a lit candle, a bouquet of tulips, a notebook and pen, and another chair. A thin gap separates the Séance Room from the Laboratory – which mirrors the same round table and circle of chairs, this time isolated into a bright room to center the focus onto the object that is “brought in” for examination.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The first object I chose was a candle, highlighting physicist William Barrett’s fascination with flame movement and his theories that they indicated an unseen connection with some supernormal influence. In his studies of “Sensitive Flames”, Barrett conducted controlled experiments on the effect of different pitches of sound on the height and divergence of a flame, ruling out causes of air movement or outside factors, and documenting his observations through testing and sketching. While modern-day explanations may not support Barrett’s conclusions about spiritual forces, his work still holds value in scientific history by providing insight into the complex dynamics of invisible forces in the atmosphere, paving the way to reach our modern understanding of these phenomena.

                Similarly, the notebook represents a séance activity known as automatic writing, which was one of the events that many believed to be a form of telepathy. Physicist Edmund Edward Fournier d’Albe was intrigued by the possibilities of higher or out-of-body consciousness, and posited that the human soul may be a substance composed of tiny particles (“psychomeres”) that held intelligence and the ability for telepathy. His research ventured into various other invisible worlds including experiments on emerging radio and television technology. As he delved into these discoveries, Fournier d’Albe envisioned a “world within worlds”, suggesting the existence of a spiritual realm within this framework. I chose to highlight Fournier d’Albe due to his highly scientific approach in studying telepathy, performing similar calculations on size and mass for “psychomeres” the way he did for his research on radio waves.

            </p>
            <p>
                The last two objects are the bouquet of tulips and the chair. I chose the tulips to symbolize some of Alfred Russel Wallace’s experiments, both due to his botanical work as a naturalist and due to the vivid imagery of his experiences with the sudden appearance of flowers during investigations with medium Agnes Guppy-Volckam. Wallace described how, after four hours in a small room, fresh flowers (including tulips) appeared on the bare table. He concluded through rigorous repeated experiments, on many phenomena in addition to the flowers, that these could not be tricks and were undeniable indications of spiritual communication, declaring “They are proved, quite as well as any facts are proved in other sciences.”

            </p>
            <p>
                The chair represents another common phenomenon which I labeled “impossible movement”, referring to levitating objects or seemingly impossible object displacement. I did not attach this phenomenon to any specific scientist, but this is another example of séance activity that Wallace has extensive documentation on in terms of his experiences and how he studied them. 

            </p><br>
            <p>
                Through these selected objects, I aimed to provide a simplified yet comprehensive view into séance activity and its overlap with science and inquiry. After experimenting with various visualizations for presenting the objects into the Laboratory side, I decided to magnify each item onto the Laboratory table, providing a short description along with a quote I liked from a corresponding primary source. The act of bringing items into the lab symbolizes a bridging of the gap between the mysterious realm of objects with powers and the observable realm of scientific investigation. This approach is essential to forming a comprehensive historical understanding of spiritualism practice and theories. 

            </p>
            <p>
                The work of these scientists serves as a reminder of the iterative nature of scientific progress. No matter the theories that develop or whether people believe them, the process of investigation and challenging conventional beliefs can contribute to the advancement of knowledge by prompting further inquiry and the refinement of existing theories. Therefore, when we look back at the history of spiritualism, we can find value in acknowledging its contributions as a movement that excited a natural curiosity that is essential towards the scientific process in any realm, physical, spiritual, or otherwise.
