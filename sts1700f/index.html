                        <p>
                            Candles and flames were often treated as a connection to the spirit world 
                            during séances, where some mediums claimed to 
                            receive messages through the movements and flickers of a flame. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            William Barrett, a prominent British physicist and psychical researcher, conducted 
                            experiments to investigate whether flames exhibited reactions indicative of 
                            spirit communication or influence. 
                            His studies of <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951000614122v;view=1up;seq=238 " target="_blank" class="w-link">"Sensitive Flames"</a> applied rigorous scientific methodology to 
                            the effect of sound on flame movement, and his findings sparked further research 
                            into phenomena that challenged conventional understanding of matter.

                        <p>
                            During séances, mediums often claimed the ability to summon objects from the spirit 
                            world as manifestations of spiritual presence. One medium, Agnes Guppy-Volckam, 
                            claimed to be able to apport flowers and fruit.  In an instance documented by Alfred 
                            Russel Wallace, Guppy-Volckman sat for four hours in a small, 
                            gas-lighted room in Wallace's home. Afterwards, a abundant array of flowers 
                            appeared on the bare table, including anemones, tulips, chrysanthemums, 
                            Chinese primroses, and ferns.

                                Wallace described the flowers

                        <p>
                            The phenomenon of automatic writing in séances describes when words and messages would 
                            wrote themselves on a page, seemingly controlled by an unseen force while 
                            the medium was in a trance-like state. This was just one example of activities that spiritualists linked 
                            to telepathic communication with a higher consciousness.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Edward Fournier d'Albe, an Irish chemist and physicist, was intrigued by such manifestations 
                            and their implications on consciousness and an immortality. <a class="w-link" href="https://archive.org/details/newlightonimmort00fourrich">His research</a> dove into the concept 
                            of "psychomeres", particules that he believed composed the human soul 
                            and could potentially condense back into a physical form after death to 
                            then facilitate telepathic communication with bodies in the physical world.

                            Impossible movement such as levitating tables or the teleportation 
                            of furniture was commonly observed during séances and heavily studied 
                            by spiritualists and scientists who
                            sought to understand their mechanisms and implications. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Scientists conducted controlled experiements within séance settings to 
                            carefully observe the movements of objects and rigorously document observations with written, photographic, 
                            and audio evidence to try and rule out explanations of fraud or mechanical trickery.
