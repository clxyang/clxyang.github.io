            <h1> Streamify - Building a Movie Aggregator in React </h1>
            <h3> Completed as part of Brown CS1300's Development assignment: </h3>
            <p> 
                I designed an interface for filtering, sorting, and favoriting of
                movies.

            <h2> 1. Competitive Analysis </h2>

            <h4 style="margin-top:0;"> Comparison Chart </h4>
            <p> Before I began, I selected 4 websites with a favoriting function to analyze the way
                they organize their information and utilize aggregators. The websites I chose were 
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com" target="_blank"> Amazon</a>,
                <a href="https://www.pinterest.com" target="_blank"> Pinterest</a>,
                <a href="https://www.nordstrom.com" target="_blank"> Nordstrom</a>, and
                <a href="https://www.urbanoutfitters.com" target="_blank"> Urban Outfitters</a>,
                and I captured my discoveries in the following
                Competitive Comparison Chart:
            </p>

            <h4 style="margin-top:0;"> Observations - Amazon </h4>
            <p>
                Having sublists with custom names is a successful feature adopted by all the websites I looked 
                at as it allows for user customization and grouping of items. This is especially successful 
                for a website like Amazon that holds a huge variety of items that can serve many purposes. 
                I think it was effective that Amazon and Urban Outfitters use an F scan pattern for this 
                where the user can see their different wishlists on a left banner while they view the items 
                of the wishlist on the right.
            </p>
            <h5 class="example-label" > Amazon wishlist display: </h5>
            <img class="example-img" src="assets/amazon-list.png">
            <p>
                Similarly for an everything-shopping site like Amazon, aggregators are important to allow 
                users to quickly organize for a certain factor, however smaller features such as search 
                may be less successful if it is quicker to just look at a list and find the item you are 
                looking for. 
            </p>

            <h4 style="margin-top:0;"> Observations - Pinterest </h4>
            <p>
                Pinterest’s purposes are very different from Amazon as the focus is on aesthetics/inspiration 
                rather than concrete shopping. Thus collaboration and grouping are the only factors they 
                implemented, leaving out any sort of aggregation within Pinterest boards themselves. I like 
                how the collaboration feature is emphasized in the visual hierarchy by placing the board 
                authors (with a +) directly below the board name.
            </p>
            <h5>Pinterest board display:</h5>

            <h4 style="margin-top:0;"> Observations - Nordstron & Urban Outfitters </h4>
            <p>
                Lastly, I looked at Nordstrom and Urban Outfitters, which have a focus on clothes unlike Amazon 
                and Pinterest. These sites were similar in their favoriting features, the most successful 
                in my opinion being to allow a “quick add” option from the favorite list to the cart, 
                and to indicate if any item is out of stock (which would replace the “quick add” option). 
                Interestingly, Nordstrom implemented a multi-select option for their favorites list which
                may not be a very necessary feature as clicking each item to multi-select and then remove/add 
                to cart takes the same amount of time as just clicking “remove” or “add to cart” on each 
                item individually. Nordstrom was also the only website to have multiple filter options,
                using a fitting checkbox UI.
            </p>
            <h5>Nordstrom multiple filters:</h5>

            <h2> 2. Planning my own implementation </h2>
            <p>
                Given these reflections, I decided on some features that
                I wanted to implement for my own list-based interface:
                <ul>
                    <li> Check box list of filter options </li>
                    <li> Sort by some measurement (such as price) </li>
                    <li> A "quick add" button to the aggregator list </li>
                    <li> Indication for if the item is already in the list </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h4 style="margin-top: 0px;">Idea</h4>
            <p> I decided to implement a movie organizer platform, Streamify, where users are able to 
                make lists for "favorited" movies or movies that they want to watch later. 
                Users will be able to filter by genre and watch time (over/under 2 hour watch 
                time). There is also a sort option to display movies by rating (taken from IMDb) or alphabetical
                by name. 
            </p>
            <h4 style="margin-top: 0px;">Rough Sketch</h4>
            <img class="example-img" style="width: 350px;" src="assets/sketch.jpg">
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>3. Results and Reflection</h2>
            <p> See the final result for Streamify <a class="deploy-link" href="https://streamify-eta-neon.vercel.app/" target="_blank">
                here</a>.  </p>

            <p> With more time, I would like to add the option to create and maintain multiple customized
                lists using the F scan pattern from the Amazon example. Additionally, I would like to 
                pull the movie cards from a large database of movies and add a search feature for users to quickly
                find any title they want to save to a list.
