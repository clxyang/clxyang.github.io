        <h1> Redesigning Providence's Bagel Gourmet Cafe Site </h1>
        <h3> Completed as part of Brown CS1300's Responsive Redesign assignment: </h3>
        <p> I analyzed and redesigned
            the 
            <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231207200946/http://bagelgourmetcafe.com/" target="_blank"> Bagel Gourmet Cafe home page </a>
             to improve on its responsiveness, usability, and accessibility,
            completing the design process cycle from sketch brainstorm up to a fully responsive HTML/CSS website. </p>

        <h2> 1. Background: Webpage Selection and Analysis </h2>

        <h4 style="margin-top:0;"> Webpage Selection </h4>
        <p> When thinking about a webpage to redesign, Bagel Gourmet's website came to mind
            as I remembered it won as the lowest accessibility rating found during class.
            The design stood out to me as I liked the fun personality and welcoming message, so I thought it would be
            interesting to use as a case study to improve their consistency and presentation which were impacting their accessibility rating.

                <p style="font-weight: bold; padding-top: 0.6rem;"> Accessibility issues for users with low vision or motor disability: </p>
                <ul style="margin: 0;">
                    <li> Low color contrast in the "Bagel gourmet cafe" title at the top left. </li>
                    <img class="curr-example-img" src="assets/original_logo.png" alt="Screenshot of the current site's logo">
                    <li> Very low color contrast in the bottom footer. </li>

                    <li> Navigation bar on the top demands precision since the bar is very narrow. </li>

                    <li> Relies heavily on color and text placement for structure. The 
                        structure also does not follow a linear logical layout.

                        the end of the text below location and contact info.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Blue and underlined
                        texts that seem like links due to being blue or underlined, but then they are not clickable.
                    </li>

                    <li style="margin-top: 6px;">
                        Efficiency: A common task users might go to the website for would be to contact the cafe to place an order/inquiry 
                        (if they don't want to call to do it).
                        This is not very easy to do as you have to click through one of the contact buttons in the top or bottom menu.
                    </li>
                </ul>        
            </div>
        </div>
    
        <p style="font-weight: bold; padding-top: 0.6rem;"> Summary using WebAIM WAVE detection: </p>
        <ol style="margin: 0;">
            <li> Errors: Missing page titles/headings </li>
            <li> Contrast errors: 12 very low contrast errors </li>
            <li> Alerts: No page regions, 5x very small text, 2x underlined text, 10x layout tables </li>
            <li> Features: 18x Null or empty alternative text</li>
        </ol>
        <p> 
            I found that WebAIM WAVE detected a high number of text readability issues with contrast and small text, 
            which I would agree with. The page is also difficult to navigate because of there being no clear page title 
            or sections with headings. Lastly, the images don’t have alternative text which can also be an accessibility 
            issue even though the images don’t necessarily play a huge role in the page. <br>
            <br>
            After analyzing potential accessibility issues through these various methods, I began to brainstorm improvements.

            <div>
                <h4 style="margin-top:0;"> Speed Sketching </h4>
                <p> 
                    For the first step of my visual redesign process, I used Procreate to create 9 speed sketches,
                    setting aside approximately 1 minute per sketch.
                </p>
                <img class="sketches-img" src="assets/sketches.png" alt="Nine speed sketches">

                <h4 style="margin-top:0;"> Final Sketch </h4>
                <p>
                    Afterwards, I analyzed the elements
                    across my sketches to build a final sketch that incorporated the pieces of design
                    that resonated with me most, which ended up being a top navigation bar and 
                    a two-column page format.
                </p>

            </div>
        </div>

        <h4> Low-Fidelity Wireframes </h4>
        <p> 
            Now that I had a base sketch, I used Figma to create low-fidelity wireframes for desktop, 
            tablet, and mobile screen sizes.
        </p>

        <div class="wireframe-section">
            <p style="font-weight: bold;"> Desktop: </p>
            <img class="wireframe-img" src="assets/lofi-desktop.png" alt="Desktop low-fidelity wireframe">
            <p style="font-weight: bold;"> Tablet: </p>
            <img class="wireframe-img" src="assets/lofi-tablet.png" alt="Tablet low-fidelity wireframe">
            <p style="font-weight: bold;"> Mobile: </p>
            <img class="wireframe-img" src="assets/lofi-mobile.png" alt="Mobile low-fidelity wireframe">
        </div>

        <h4> Visual Design Style Guide </h4>
        <p> 
            As I polished my wireframes and added in detail, I maintained a visual design 
            style guide that displayed my reusable colors, typography, icons, and button states.
        </p>
        <img id="style-guide-img" src="assets/style-guide.png" alt="Visual design style guide">

        <p> 
            This eased the process of finalizing high-fidelity wireframes for each screen size.
        </p>

        <h4> High-Fidelity Wireframes </h4>

        <div class="wireframe-section">
            <p style="font-weight: bold;"> Desktop: </p>
            <img class="wireframe-img" src="assets/hifi-desktop.png" alt="Desktop high-fidelity wireframe">

            <img class="wireframe-img" src="assets/hifi-tablet.png" alt="Tablet high-fidelity wireframe">
            <p style="font-weight: bold;"> Mobile: </p>
            <img class="wireframe-img" src="assets/hifi-mobile.png" alt="Mobile high-fidelity wireframe">

        <h2> 3. Responsive Redesign: Translating to HTML/CSS </h2>
        <p> 
            The final step was to create the page using HTML and CSS. I also used
            a few lines of JavaScript to allow for the opening/closing of the hamburger
            menu on tablet/mobile screen sizes. <br>
            <br>
            The site should be fully responsive on a phone (~375x667px), 
            a tablet (~768x1024px), a large computer (~3840x2160px), and any dimensions in between.
            Additionally, in WebAIM it achieves 0 errors and 0 contrast errors. :) <br>
